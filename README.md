# Accurate Video on AWS ECS

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Install [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [Configure CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html)
- Add image repository credentials to [Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/)

### Configuration

The Frontend, Adapter and Jobs applications currently loads configuration files from an S3 storage that is created by the infrastructure template. We've included templates for these files in the [config directory](./config) that you can use as your base of creating the proper configuration.

Before uploading each configuration file, you need to remove the `_template` suffix from the file name, and replace or set the values that are needed for your deployment.

- `config/frontend/keycloak.json` is needed if you're using Keycloak as your authentication solution, in it you'll need to replace `AV_KEYCLOAK_URL` with the URL of your Keycloak Realm.
- `config/frontend/settings.js` contains the frontend configuration, in it you'll need to replace `AV_LICENSE_KEY` with a valid Accurate Video license key, and configure the behaviour of the application.
- `config/backend/cluster.xml` contains a Hazelcast configuration that is shared between Adapter and Jobs to talk over an event bus instead of using a polling mechanism.

After you've renamed and updated the configuration files you'll need to upload them to the configuration bucket that was created by the infrastructure template.

If you're manually applying each template and not using `deploy.sh` you also need to upload the files to the configuration bucket:

```sh
aws s3 cp --recursive ./config/frontend s3://${CONFIG_BUCKET}/frontend
aws s3 cp --recursive ./config/backend s3://${CONFIG_BUCKET}/backend
```

### Create ECS cluster running Accurate Video

You can either manually upload the templates to Cloud Formation or use our interactive script that bootstraps a new ECS cluster running Accurate Video.

```sh
./deploy.sh
```
